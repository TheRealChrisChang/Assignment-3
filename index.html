                Love Letter is a great gateway game to board games.
                Easy to pick up and hard to put down.
                Each player is taking cupid's arrow and shooting his shot, or her shot, at the princess with a love letter.
                After the deck is shuffled and dealt, the first player begins and draws from the center deck.
                Then, the turn player discards and plays one card from the hand activating its effects.
                The goal is to knock players out of the round with card effects and be the last one standing to win a token of affection.
                The player that gains the right amount of token of affections wins. 
                If you like Black Jack or Poker, you will fall for Love Letter.
                The aspects of bluffing and counting cards will make a player closer to the princess's heart.

                Codenames is another gateway board game for people to get into the hobby.
                Between two teams, each team is secretly giving hints to contact secret agents with secret words.
                The team who guesses all their secret agents first wins, but there is a twist.
                Each team has a spy master who gives clues to the rest of the team.
                In a 5 x 5 grid of words, the spy masters see what words they need to contact as well as the other teams.
                However, the rest of the players just look at the grid waiting for hints from their spy master.
                In turns, the turn spy master gives the amount of cards to guess and an appropriate hint that can relate or be related to the clue.
                For example, 3 guesses and hint bird.
                The rest of the team have to guess and decipher what could it mean.
                If you enjoy the board game Taboo, then this game is right up your alley.
                Or, if you also enjoy riddles and brain teasers, this game will give your brain a run for its money.

        <h2>Settlers of Catan Review</h2>
        <div class="review">

            <p class="indent">
                Catan, is like Monopoly but better. 
                Just like Monopoly each player is building an enterprise,
                and each player viciously takes and trades resources to build a city of their own.
                At first glance, Catan looks very complicated to a novice board game player.
                However, Catan is not that hard once you know how the turn goes.
                At the start of the game, players in clockwise order places a settlement on the board and road.
                Rinse and repeat the process, starting with the last player and this time counter clockwise, until both settlements from each player is on the board.
                Then the first player goes and at the start of each player's turn the turn player rolls two six-sided dice.
                When the dice is done rolling add the sum of the two and each settlement produces material for that player's settlement.
                These materials is currency and resources to help build and expand a player's city or barter and trade with other players.

                <em> W A R N I N G : </em>I must warn you, I have seen this game end friendships and cause arguments at a family gathering.
                But, what's the difference? 
                I've seen arguments regardless of Catan.
                Anyhow, if you like Monopoly but feel like there is too much RnG, -- random number generation -- then try Settlers of Catan.
                Any veteran board game hobbyist would recommend Catan.
                Settlers of Catan is a classic now and a classic in the future.
